In this folder there is the Vanilla RP implementation of the Watershed algorithm 

used for image segmentation (especially "tuned" for tissue images).

___
You can run the code after you have installed the necessary dependancies by typing in a terminal:

python RP_watershed.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5

where 
      
    arg1 = pilot cores  
      
    arg2 = number of CUs  
      
    arg3 = number of images to segment  
      
    arg4 = report name 
      
    arg5 = resource (optionally)
