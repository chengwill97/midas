To install scikit-beam try the following command:

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-beam 



All our software is available using conda or pip.   So in ‘theory’ you should be 
able to get our data collection environment using:

    conda install -c lightsource2-tag collection 



Data collection requires python 3.5. To create a conda virtual environment with python3.5:

    conda create -n nslsve python==3.5
